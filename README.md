# LawBot – RAG + LLM + AI Legal Aid

LawBot is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based AI Legal Assistant designed to provide context-grounded answers from uploaded legal PDF documents. The system ensures responses are strictly derived from document content, minimizing hallucinations and improving reliability for legal research and analysis.

The architecture supports both local and cloud-based large language models, making it flexible for development, experimentation, and deployment.

---

## Overview

LawBot enables the users to:

- Upload legal documents (acts, case files, contracts, policies, etc.)
- Perform semantic search over document content
- Generate context-aware answers using a configurable LLM backend
- Operate fully offline using local models or leverage a cloud LLM via API

The system follows a modular RAG pipeline separating document processing, retrieval, and generation layers.

## Core Features

- PDF ingestion and text extraction
- Recursive chunking with overlap for better semantic retrieval
- Embedding generation using Ollama
- FAISS-based vector similarity search
- Configurable LLM backend (Local or Groq API)
- Strict prompt design to prevent hallucinated responses
- Persistent local vector storage

## System Workflow

### Document Processing Phase
1. Upload PDF document.
2. Extract text using PDFPlumber.
3. Split text into overlapping chunks.
4. Generate embeddings using `nomic-embed-text`.
5. Store embeddings in a FAISS vector index.

### Query Processing Phase
1. User submits a question.
2. FAISS performs Top-K similarity retrieval.
3. Retrieved chunks are aggregated as context.
4. Context is injected into a structured prompt.
5. Selected LLM generates a grounded response.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd LawBot
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment:

Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Mac/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Create `requirements.txt`:

```
streamlit
python-dotenv
langchain
langchain-community
langchain-core
langchain-ollama
langchain-text-splitters
faiss-cpu
pdfplumber
langchain-groq
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Local LLM Setup (Ollama)

Install Ollama from:

https://ollama.com/download

Pull required models:

```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1:1.5b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

### 5. Cloud LLM Setup (Groq)

1. Create a `.env` file:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. In `rag_pipeline.py`, enable Groq:

```python
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
llm_model = ChatGroq(model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile")
```

## Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run frontend.py
```

Access the application at:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

---

## Reliability and Hallucination Control

The prompt design enforces:

- Strict use of provided context
- No fabricated legal information
- A fallback response:

```
"I don't know based on the provided document."
```

This ensures document-grounded, reliable outputs suitable for legal assistance workflows.
